## Troubleshooting

<Collapse title="What should I do if a query fails?">
- Verify that the model and provider are correctly configured.
- Ensure the secret keys for providers are valid and up-to-date.
- Check the input data for any inconsistencies.
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="How do I debug API-related errors?">
- Check your API usage limits and ensure the key is active.
- Use the `GET SECRET` command to confirm the correct key is being used.
- Look at error messages from the provider (e.g., OpenAI or Azure).
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="Why is the response time slow for some queries?">
Response times may vary based on:
- The provider (e.g., API latency for OpenAI or Azure).
- The complexity of the query.
- Hardware limitations (for local inference with Ollama).
- The batch size used during inference.
- The model's context window:
  - Larger context windows may increase processing time.
  - Smaller context windows with large datasets can lead to multiple API calls, increasing latency.
